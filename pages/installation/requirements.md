# Embedded Cluster Installation Requirements

Ensure your environment meets these requirements before installing with Embedded Cluster.

<Tip title="SlackerNews Prerequisites">
Before installing, make sure you have completed the [Getting Started prerequisites](../getting-started/prerequisites), including setting up your [domain](../getting-started/domain) and [Slack app](../getting-started/slack-app).
</Tip>

## System Requirements

- Linux operating system
- x86-64 architecture
- systemd
- At least 2GB of memory and 2 CPU cores
- Disk write latency: Maximum P99 write latency of 10ms (required for etcd performance)

<Warning title="Disk Latency">
Installations on systems that exceed 10ms P99 write latency may experience etcd instability, leading to cluster failures. Verify disk performance before proceeding.
</Warning>

- Root access or `sudo` privileges
- Data directory requirements:
  - 40Gi or more of total space
  - Less than 80% full
  - Default location: `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`
  - Can be changed with the `--data-dir` flag during installation

<Note title="Custom Data Directory">
If your system has a dedicated data volume mounted at a path other than `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`, use the `--data-dir` flag during installation to point to it. This must be set at install time and cannot be changed later.
</Note>

## Port Requirements

The following ports must be open and available for Embedded Cluster installations.

### Ports Used by Local Processes

These ports must be available for local processes (no firewall openings needed):

- 2379/TCP
- 7443/TCP
- 9099/TCP
- 10248/TCP
- 10257/TCP
- 10259/TCP

### Ports for Node Communication

These ports are used for bidirectional communication between nodes in multi-node installations. Create firewall openings between nodes for these ports:

- 2380/TCP
- 4789/UDP
- 6443/TCP
- 9091/TCP
- 9443/TCP
- 10249/TCP
- 10250/TCP
- 10256/TCP

### Admin Console Port

Port **30000/TCP** must be open and accessible for the Admin Console. This port must also be accessible by nodes joining the cluster.

If port 30000 is occupied, you can select a different port during installation using the `--admin-console-port` flag.

### Local Artifact Mirror (LAM) Port

Port **50000/TCP** must be open for the Local Artifact Mirror.

If port 50000 is occupied, you can select a different port during installation.

## Firewalld Configuration

If Firewalld is enabled in your environment, Embedded Cluster will automatically configure it to allow necessary traffic. No additional configuration is required.

The following ports are automatically opened in the default zone:

- 6443/TCP
- 10250/TCP
- 9443/TCP
- 2380/TCP
- 4789/UDP

## Additional System Directories

In addition to the primary data directory, Embedded Cluster creates files in these locations:

- `/etc/cni`
- `/etc/k0s`
- `/opt/cni`
- `/opt/containerd`
- `/run/calico`
- `/run/containerd`
- `/run/k0s`
- `/var/lib/calico`
- `/var/lib/cni`
- `/var/lib/containers`
- `/var/lib/kubelet`
- `/var/log/embedded-cluster`
- `/usr/local/bin/k0s`
